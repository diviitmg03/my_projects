## ðŸ“‚ **Projects**

### 1. **valuating Lightweight Open-Source LLMs for Mental Health Counselling: A Comparative Study**
- **Description**: A project to evaluate the performance of lightweight open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) in mental health counseling applications.
- **Key Features**:
  - Fine-tuning models like **BART**, **Flan-T5**, **GPT-2**, **GODEL** on a curated dataset.
  - Comparing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - Analyzing the models' responses for empathy and context-awareness.
- **Folder**: `Mental_Health_counselling using LLMs`

### 2. **Abusive Language Detection Using Recurrent Neural Networks**
- **Description**: This project focuses on detecting offensive language in tweets using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).
- **Key Features**:
  - Classifies tweets into **hate speech**, **offensive language**, and **neutral language** categories.
  - Implements RNN-based classification with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - Dataset of 24,783 labeled tweets.
- **Folder**: `Abusive_language_detection`

### 3. **Smart Traffic Light Management**
- **Description**: A project aimed at optimizing traffic management using YOLOv5 for real-time vehicle detection and Arduino for controlling traffic lights dynamically.
- **Key Features**:
  - Real-time vehicle detection.
  - Dynamic control of traffic lights to optimize waiting times.
  - Cost-effective solution utilizing phone cameras.
- **Folder**: `Smart Traffic Light`

### 4. **Oggy and the Cockroaches - A Pac-Man Inspired Game**
- **Description**:A fun, interactive game where you control Oggy through a maze, collecting points and avoiding cockroaches. The game resets upon losing all lives.
- **Key Features**:
  - Navigate a maze, collect points, and avoid enemies.
  - Score and lives tracking with real-time updates.
  - Automatic reset with a "Game Over" screen.
- **Folder**: `pac_man_game`
